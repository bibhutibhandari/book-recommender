book-recommender
==============================

A simple yet efficient book recommender with collaborative based filtering.
This is a basic book recommendation engine that uses cosine similarity to measure the similarity between books based on user ratings.

- Loads a user-item rating matrix (books rated by users)
- Computes the cosine similarity between books
- Enables basic recommendations (e.g., find similar books to a given title)

Cosine similarity is used to measure how similar two books are based on the pattern of ratings they received from different users.
